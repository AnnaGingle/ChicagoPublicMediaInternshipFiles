keyFindings
"Radio / Radio schedule confusion -Let's combine them   -This will also fix the confusion users had with context   "
"Users prefer jumping into safari when donating -In app browsing doesn't support auto fill   -Complements on donation page   -Let's not make extra work for ourselves to be trendy, let's be usable"
"Burger menu confusion - users expect to find ""their"" settings their  - account, saved items, MY PODCASTS   I think this is a scope issue, overall every usability issue passed"
"Users jump forward / backward on lock screen"
"Uses seek bar when listening more actively, more interaction heavy"
"Context confusion -should be resolved with typography implementation -with future plans to improve / match user expectations"

"Find and and open the WBEZ app.","n
How do I go back to it?
I went to the menu
Did not notice bottom navigation, tried to use bottom navigation"
"Without leaving the homepage, describe what you would select first. **Do not select anything yet.** If you would leave without clicking anywhere, please explain why. [Verbal response]","Answered this question in response to #1
See what features to understand what it is
burger menu because I wanted to see where I was and if this is the landing page"
"Use the app to listen to the live broadcast.","Didn't use collapsed player or Listen Live Now
Radio and then thats the first thing thats up
Successfully completed task"
"You want to see more information about what you’re currently listening to. How would you go about that?","n
Clicked into collapsed player
r, try to find out more by playing around, nothings there, I don't know i'm stuck
I dont think there is a way
There's 1A here and yesterday, what's the difference?
I'd much rather the expanded player scroll up to show more information"
"5.) Now let's say you have to pause the live broadcast for a moment. Pause the live stream.","n
Successfully completed task"
"Now you want to continue listening. How would you make sure you're listening to what's playing live now? Please think out loud as much as possible. [Verbal response]","Opens up collapsed player, presses play
Pressed skip to live
I could see that there was a delay on the toggle bar, and the button also indicated that so I opened up the collapsed player
Skip to live, that's a really nice feature"
"You just realized you missed something you wanted to hear about 20 seconds ago. How would you do that?","n
Tries to toggle
I would go back in and pause it
Bad toggle touch feature
I think the 10 sec button would be easier"
"Use the app to listen to a recent highlight that looks interesting to you. Speak out loud as you do so.","This actually looks like the home feature I was looking for
I consider podcasts more of a menu feature
The collapses player has some time, functionality, presumably because the back button doesn't work
It would be interesting know the original time of air, whos speaking"
"What is the difference between browse and home to you?","home page has the ability to drill into something that you're interested in
Browse is something more cataloged based on types business, sports
Or more high level features like Listen Live
Like a search feature more detailed"
"What do you expect to happen after you've finished listening to a recent highlight? Did this experience match your expectations? Why or why not? [Verbal response]","I much prefer the radio schedule because it gives me more information."
"Can you use the toggle to go forward 2 mins and 30 seconds","It's buggy
Successfully completed task

Goes to full radio schedule
There we go! I like the information that is provided"

Browse, radio, I'm confused between the radio and the radio schedule page.
Thought radio was radio schedule
Radio schedule is hard is find
He's fusteraded because bottom nav looks the same for both radio and radio schedule"
"Let's say you wanted to donate to WBEZ, What would you do? Please think out aloud while doing so."
"What do you expect to happen after you've finished listening to a recent highlight? Did the Donate experience match your expectations? Why or why not? [Verbal response]","I prefer the donate popping out to safari because I can use autofill"
